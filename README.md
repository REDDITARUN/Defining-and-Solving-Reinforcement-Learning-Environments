# Defining and Solving Reinforcement Learning Environments

## üìã Project Description

This project involves defining and solving various reinforcement learning (RL) environments using SARSA and tabular methods such as Q-learning and Double Q-learning. We explore both deterministic and stochastic environments across different scenarios: Frozen Lake, Lawn Mower, and Squirrel Maze. And we apply these techniques to a stock trading environment to demonstrate the versatility of these algorithms.
